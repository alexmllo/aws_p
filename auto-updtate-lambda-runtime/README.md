**Scenario**

We received a report from the security team highlighting that hundreds of Lambda functions are using outdated runtimes, such as Python 3.8 and Node.js 14.x. Since AWS doesn’t automatically upgrade Lambda runtimes, these outdated versions must be addressed manually.

Updating each Lambda function manually would be time-consuming.

**What will we do?**

 Automating Lambda runtime updates. We’ll build a Python script that accepts the desired runtime versions as input, identifies Lambda functions using unsupported versions, and updates them to the specified runtime.

*Note:* Often, AWS infrastructure, including Lambda functions, is provisioned using tools like Terraform. In such cases, updating the runtime can also be managed by modifying the Terraform code.

**Steps to Automate Lambda Runtime Updates**

1. Initialize a Boto3 client for Lambda.
2. Retrieve a list of all Lambda functions within a specified AWS region.
3. Identify the runtime version for each Lambda function.
4. Check if the runtime is outdated compared to the desired version.
5. Update the Lambda runtime to the specified version if needed.

Throughout this guide, we’ll also incorporate best practices to ensure a robust, reusable solution.
